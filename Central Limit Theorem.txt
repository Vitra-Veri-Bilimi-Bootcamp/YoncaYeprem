Central Limit Theorem

When you have a dataset (or population), its distribution does not matter(it can be normal,uniform,nominal),if you start sampling from the dataset and take sufficient number of 
random samples and then calculate the mean of each sample, you will see that the mean of the samples took from dataset will approximate a normal distribution. The  number of 
samples getting bigger, they will more closer to a normal distribution.Their distribution will have almost same mean as original datasets mean and the variance will almost be the 
variance of the original dataset divided by the number of samples too.
